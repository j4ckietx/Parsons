	<h2 id="successful"> Dribbble - A Community of Designers</h2>
        
		<p>
        <a href="http://dribbble.com">Dribbble.com</a> is one of the most well designed online sharing community platforms I have encountered becasue of its distintive branding and the usability. The website is designed with a simple goal and it chose the most direct design to accomplish it. Dribbble is a relatively exclusive online community for designers to post their work, get inspiration, and get hired. The homepage of dribbble, from the perspective of a user first enters the platform, has a really straight-forward function. It introduces its function, has a clear navigation system to invite users, and showcases trending works from inside the community to examplify what users can gain from the community after signing up. Before signing up for a new online community, users need to figure out what the website is about, decide if signing up is neccesary, what is the value of long-term usage, and commit to completing the registration process. Dribbble's design and interface made the whole process quick, and contained all the information within one page to make it simple, which is why it is a well-designed online platform in the perspective of a new user.</p>

		<p>Other than doing a successful job atttracting new users to sign up for the website, Dribbble is also good at keeping people active on the platform by providing consistant service and easy interface. After registering and getting invitation codes from accredited userd, designers are permitted to post their old projects into the portal. With project shots catergorized in "Recent", "Popular", and "Debut". The system successfully makes sure that everybody has an equal chance of exposure in the community. New users will get enough exposure by having their first project post in the "Debut" group and gain incentive to stay inside the community from the results of the initial exposure. The "Popular" tab keeps the high-quality projects on the front page for users and outsiders to view, to ensure the quality of the community and the goal of being "inspirational". User are also allowed to personalize the feeds by following interested users and teams, with a customed portal and the exposure system, dribbble is building a successful website and online platform. </p>

	<h2 id="less-successful">Forbes - A News Agency Flooded with Advertisements</h2>	
	    <p>
	    <a href="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes,</a> is the last online news sourse I would go on for any information. It has a consistant branding design that looks credibal and authoritative, yet it is neither an efficient process for learning new information, nor a pleasant experience for viewing a website. The only and obvious problem is the amount and scale of advertisement all over Forbes. Ads are located everywhere from homepage to pop-up windows, from the center of the page to large image boxes. The distraction from ads is even worse since Forbes decides to go with a simple look of white texts over black background and large news photos. Ads are mostly graphic images, and they tend to be the most attractive element on a webpage. Forbes not only place the most graphic ads inside the website, but also make them look identical with the news images and even larger than most of the news sections. Whenever users go on Forbes, Ads will be the first and only thing they can see, which destroys the one and only function of a news website, which is to acquire new and useful information. It is clear that by adding advertisement in this way and scale, Forbes completely lost the efficiency and satisfaction for users to acquiring information.</p>
