	<h4>What is the purpose of the website?</h4>
        
		<p> The website's purpose is to be an online portolio that gives a brief introduction of the website owner and showcase the previous works and achievements of hers in a professional form. </p>
        
    <h4>Who is the intended audience?</h4>
        
		<p> The intended audience will be peers who study in the same field and recruiters who are looking for designers to hire. </p>    
        
    <h4>What tone do you want for the siteâ€™s written content?</h4>
        
		<p> I'd like to keep the style of the visual design and written content as objective and professional as possible. Personal information may not be a part of the content. Besides the design projects that will be posted onto the portfolio, the website design and written content themselves are also a part of the "previous work". But this doesn't mean that the tone of the writings can't be light and cheerful. </p>
        
    <h4>What will be the primary content of your site?</h4>
        
		<p> The main content will be the previous design works I have done, including school assignments, freelance works, and personal projects. An ideal plan is that the three different categories can be seperated from each other since the school assignments are usually more conceptual, while the freelance works have their real-world functions. </p>
        
    <h4>What will be the secondary content</h4>
        
		<p> A less essential part of the content will be a blog page that works as a chronological documentation that updates the my latest skill set and ongoing projects. </p>
        
    <h4>How will users navigate through your site?</h4>
        
		<p>Users will navigate through the site by scrolling and a main navigation bar. Main categories like "portfolio", "about", and "blog" will be parts of the navigation bar. Any sub-categories under these sections will be seperated and navigated by scrolling through a long vertical page sectioned by different background design. Sub-categories can also be navigated through drop-down menus from the navigation bar.</p>
